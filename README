-=// Ferguson SRB1 (BSB D-MAC receiver/decoder) \\=-

An emulator for exploring a 90s satellite from BSB, a
UK satellite TV service that lasted less than a year.

Current status: Can display the LED digits and various
OSD displays, but not much else. There are probably bugs
in the 65c02 emulator too. The charset is incomplete and
there is no IR remote control support yet.

firmware-srb1.bin: FerR2.0e
firmware-acm.bin: ACM firmware V1.50
bbram-acm.bin: Optional ACM battery backed RAM

UI keys:

   esc = Quit
   q   = Standby
   w   = P+
   e   = P-
   r   = Setup
